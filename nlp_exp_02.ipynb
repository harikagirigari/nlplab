All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Attribute Information:**\\\\n1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy \\\\n\\\\n2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss \\\\n\\\\n3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) \\\\n\\\\n4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) \\\\n\\\\n5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) \\\\n\\\\n6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) \\\\n\\\\n7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). \\\\n\\\\n8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. \\\\n\\\\n9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).

I really need how to do a regression and clustering manipulating this data.\\nSorry about the format, it's in text file. \\n**Thanks in advance :)**\\n\\n**Context:** Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**  \\nMultivariate, Time-Series\\n\\n**Associated Tasks:**\\nRegression, Clustering\\n\\n**Data Set Information:**\\n\\nThis archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months). \\nNotes: \\n1.(global_active_power*1000/60 - sub_metering_1 - sub_metering_2 - sub_metering_3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3. \\n\\n2.The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1,25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.\\n\\n\\n**Attribute Information:**\\n1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy \\n\\n2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss \\n\\n3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) \\n\\n4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) \\n\\n5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) \\n\\n6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) \\n\\n7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). \\n\\n8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. \\n\\n9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.\",\"url\":\"https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set\",\"version\":1,\"keywords\":[\"subject, science and technology, energy, electricity\"],\"license\":{\"@type\":\"CreativeWork\",\"name\":\"Database: Open Database, Contents: Database Contents\",\"url\":\"http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/\"},\"identifier\":[\"122\"],\"includedInDataCatalog\":{\"@type\":\"DataCatalog\",\"name\":\"Kaggle\",\"url\":\"https://www.kaggle.com\"},\"creator\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"UCI Machine Learning\",\"url\":\"https://www.kaggle.com/organizations/uciml\",\"image\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-organizations/7/thumbnail.png\"},\"distribution\":[{\"@type\":\"DataDownload\",\"requiresSubscription\":true,\"encodingFormat\":\"zip\",\"fileFormat\":\"zip\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set/download?datasetVersionNumber=1\",\"contentSize\":\"20357475 bytes\"}],\"commentCount\":6,\"dateModified\":\"2016-08-23T17:02:15.51Z\",\"discussionUrl\":\"https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set/discussion\",\"alternateName\":\"time series analysis- regression / clustering\",\"isAccessibleForFree\":true,\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/122/260/46fddab9a36e911c711f85624ac0081f/dataset-card.jpeg\",\"interactionStatistic\":[{\"@type\":\"InteractionCounter\",\"interactionType\":\"http://schema.org/CommentAction\",\"userInteractionCount\":6},{\"@type\":\"InteractionCounter\",\"interactionType\":\"http://schema.org/DownloadAction\",\"userInteractionCount\":60988},{\"@type\":\"InteractionCounter\",\"interactionType\":\"http://schema.org/ViewAction\",\"userInteractionCount\":399394},{\"@type\":\"InteractionCounter\",\"interactionType\":\"http://schema.org/LikeAction\",\"userInteractionCount\":437}]}</script>\n",
